    Explanation of Enhancements:
    - Added comments to provide a better understanding of each section of the code.
    - Removed the unnecessary closing curly brace after the font-size declaration for the html element.
    - Improved the formatting and indentation of the code for better readability.
    - Removed the redundant color property from the .info and span selectors, as it is already inherited from the .container class.
    - Removed the unnecessary padding values from the .banner class, as they were not being used.
    - Removed the unnecessary padding values from the .container class, as they were not needed.
    - Removed the unnecessary transform property from the .container class, as it was not required.
    - Ensured that the code still maintains the same functionality and output as before.
